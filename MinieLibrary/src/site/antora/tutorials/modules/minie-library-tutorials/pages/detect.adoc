= Collision detection

Minie provides 4 collision-detection interfaces:

. You can add collision listeners to a `PhysicsSpace`
  to be notified about up to 4 collision contacts per colliding object,
  including references to both objects.
. You can add collision-group listeners to a `PhysicsSpace`
  to be notified about collisions involving particular groups.
. You can add ragdoll-collision listeners to any `DynamicAnimControl`
  to be notified about collision contacts involving its ragdoll
  where the applied impulse exceeds a certain threshold.
  (This is built atop interface #1.)
. You can invoke `getOverlappingObjects()` on any `PhysicsGhostObject`
  to enumerate all collision objects that overlap with it,
  based on axis-aligned bounding boxes.
