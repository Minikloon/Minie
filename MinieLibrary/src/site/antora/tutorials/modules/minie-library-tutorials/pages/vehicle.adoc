= An introduction to vehicle physics

The {url-api}/object/PhysicsVehicle.html[`PhysicsVehicle`]
class (a subclass of {url-api}/object/PhysicsRigidBody.html[`PhysicsRigidBody`])
provides a simplified physics model for vehicles.

To associate a vehicle with a `Spatial`, there's
{url-api}/control/VehicleControl.html[`VehicleControl`],
a physics control that extends
{url-api}/objects/PhysicsVehicle.html[`PhysicsVehicle`].

NOTE: Yet again, the physics control and its collision object
are the same object.
