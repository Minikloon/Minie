= An introduction to `DynamicAnimControl`
:url-tutorial: https://github.com/stephengold/Minie/blob/master/MinieExamples/src/main/java/jme3utilities/tutorial

The centerpiece of Minie is `DynamicAnimControl`, a kind of `PhysicsControl`.
Adding a `DynamicAnimControl` to an animated model
provides ragdoll physics and inverse kinematics.
`DynamicAnimControl` can also be used to simulate ropes.

Configuration of `DynamicAnimControl` mostly takes place
before the `Control` is added to a model `Spatial`.
Adding the `Control` to a `Spatial` automatically creates the ragdoll,
including rigid bodies and joints.
No ragdoll exists before the `Control` is added to a `Spatial`,
and removing a `Control` from its controlled `Spatial` destroys the ragdoll.

The controlled `Spatial`
must include the model's `SkinningControl` or `SkeletonControl`.
Usually this is the model's root `Spatial`, but not always.
If unsure about the model's structure, use `MySpatial.listAnimationSpatials()`.
For a very simple example, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloDac.java[HelloDac.java].

A model's ragdoll is composed of rigid bodies joined by physics joints.
Within the `Control`, each `PhysicsRigidBody` is represented by
a `PhysicsLink`, and the links are organized in a tree hierarchy.

`PhysicsLink` has 3 subclasses:

* `BoneLink`: manages one or more bones in the modelâ€™s `Skeleton`.
  Each `BoneLink` has a parent link, to which it is jointed.
  Its parent may be another `BoneLink` or it may be a `TorsoLink`.
* `TorsoLink`: is always the root of a link hierarchy,
  so it has no parent link.
  It manages all root bones in the model's `Skeleton`.  It also manages any
  `Skeleton` bones that aren't managed by a `BoneLink`.
* `AttachmentLink`: manages a non-animated model that's
  attached to the main model by means of an attachment `Node`.
  An `AttachmentLink` cannot be the parent of a link.

The default constructor for `DynamicAnimControl` is configured to create a
ragdoll with no bone links, only a `TorsoLink`.
Before adding the `Control` to a `Spatial`, specify which bones
should be linked, by invoking the `link()` method for each of those bones.
The order in which bones are linked does not matter.

I recommend starting with a default `LinkConfig` and a generous range of motion
for each linked bone:

[source,java]
----
dynamicAnimControl.link(boneName, new LinkConfig(), new RangeOfMotion(1f, 1f, 1f));
----

For a simple example, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloBoneLink.java[HelloBoneLink].

When you run `HelloBoneLink`, press the space bar to put the control into
dynamic mode.
You'll see the linked bones go limp while the remainder of the Ninja model
stays rigid.

As an alternative to hand-coding the control configuration,
you can generate configuration code for a specific model using
https://github.com/stephengold/Minie/tree/master/DacWizard[the DacWizard application],
which samples animation tracks to estimate
the range of motion for each linked bone.

You probably don't want to link every `Bone` in the model's `Skeleton`.
For instance, if the model has articulated fingers, you probably want to link
the hand bones but not the individual finger bones.
Unlinked bones will be managed by the nearest linked ancestor `Bone`.
The `TorsoLink` will manage any bones for which no ancestor `Bone` is linked.
If you link too many bones, the ragdoll may become inflexible or jittery
due to collisions between rigid bodies that don't share a `PhysicsJoint`.
