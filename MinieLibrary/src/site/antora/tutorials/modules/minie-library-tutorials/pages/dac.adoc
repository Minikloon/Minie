The centerpiece of Minie is `DynamicAnimControl`, a kind of `PhysicsControl`.
Adding a `DynamicAnimControl` to an animated model
provides ragdoll physics and inverse kinematics.
`DynamicAnimControl` can also be used to simulate ropes.

Configuration of `DynamicAnimControl` mostly takes place
before the control is added to a model spatial.
Adding the control to a spatial automatically creates the ragdoll,
including rigid bodies and physics joints.
No ragdoll exists before the control is added to a spatial,
and removing a control from its controlled spatial destroys the ragdoll.

The controlled spatial
must include the model's `SkinningControl` or `SkeletonControl`.
Often these controls are found in model's root spatial, but not always.
If unsure about a model's structure, use `MySpatial.listAnimationSpatials()`.
For a very simple example, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloDac.java[HelloDac.java].

NOTE:  In Minie documentation,
the word _skeleton_ refers to both `com.jme3.animation.Skeleton` instances
and `com.jme3.anim.Armature` instances.
Similarly, the word _bone_ refers to both `com.jme3.animation.Bone` instances
and `com.jme3.anim.Joint` instances.
In contexts where "joint" might be ambiguous,
the phrases _physics joint_ (for `com.jme3.bullet.joints.PhysicsJoint`)
and _skeleton joint_ (for `com.jme3.anim.Joint') are used.

A model's ragdoll is composed of rigid bodies joined by physics joints.
Within the control, each `PhysicsRigidBody` is represented by
a `PhysicsLink`, and the links are organized in a tree hierarchy.

`PhysicsLink` has 3 subclasses:

* `BoneLink`: manages one or more bones in the modelâ€™s skeleton.
  Each `BoneLink` has a parent link, to which it is jointed.
  Its parent may be another `BoneLink` or it may be a `TorsoLink`.
* `TorsoLink`: is always the root of a link hierarchy,
  so it has no parent link.
  It manages all root bones in the model's skeleton.  It also manages any
  skeleton bones that aren't managed by a `BoneLink`.
* `AttachmentLink`: manages a non-animated model that's
  attached to the main model by means of an attachment `Node`.
  An `AttachmentLink` cannot be the parent of a link.

The default constructor for `DynamicAnimControl` is configured to create a
ragdoll with no bone links, only a `TorsoLink`.
Before adding the control to a spatial, specify which bones
should be linked, by invoking the `link()` method for each of those bones.
The order in which bones are linked doesn't matter.

I recommend starting with a default `LinkConfig` and a generous range of motion
for each linked bone:

[source,java]
----
dynamicAnimControl.link(boneName, new LinkConfig(), new RangeOfMotion(1f, 1f, 1f));
----

For a simple example, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloBoneLink.java[HelloBoneLink].

When you run `HelloBoneLink`, press the space bar to put the control into
dynamic mode.
You'll see the linked bones go limp while the remainder of the Ninja model
stays rigid.

As an alternative to hand-coding the control configuration,
you can generate configuration code for a specific model using
https://github.com/stephengold/Minie/tree/master/DacWizard[the DacWizard application],
which samples animation tracks to estimate
the range of motion for each linked bone.

You probably don't want to link every bone in the model's skeleton.
For instance, if the model has articulated fingers, you probably want to link
the hand bones but not the individual finger bones.
Unlinked bones will be managed by the nearest linked ancestor bone.
The `TorsoLink` will manage any bones for which no ancestor bone is linked.
If you link too many bones, the ragdoll may become inflexible or jittery
due to collisions between rigid bodies that don't share a `PhysicsJoint`.
