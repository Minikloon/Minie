This page acts as a holding area for tutorial material that's waiting
to be organized.

== Global configuration

By default, the native library prints a startup message to `System.out`.
Once the library is loaded (but not started) you can disable this message:

[source,java]
----
NativeLibrary.setStartupMessageEnabled(false);
----

Once the native library is loaded,
you can test whether it uses double-precision arithmetic:

[source,java]
----
boolean doublePrecision = NativeLibrary.isDoublePrecision();
----

You can also test whether it was built for debugging
(with assertions enabled, symbols not stripped,
and debug information generated):

[source,java]
----
boolean debug = NativeLibrary.isDebug();
----

The default collision margin for new shapes is 0.04 physics-space units.
To configure a default margin of 0.1 psu:

[source,java]
----
CollisionShape.setDefaultMargin(0.1f);
----

NOTE: The Bullet Manual advises against changing the default margin.

== Broadphase types

By default, a Dynamic Bounding-Volume Tree (DBVT) is used for broadphase
collision detection.
To specify a different data structure, use `setBroadphaseType()`
on the appstate:

[source,java]
----
SoftPhysicsAppState bas = new SoftPhysicsAppState();
bas.setBroadphaseType(PhysicsSpace.BroadphaseType.AXIS_SWEEP_3);
bas.setWorldMax(new Vector3f(1000f, 10f, 1000f));
bas.setWorldMin(new Vector3f(-1000f, -10f, -1000f));
stateManager.attach(bas);
PhysicsSoftSpace physicsSpace = bas.getPhysicsSoftSpace();
----

NOTE: The world max/min bounds are used
only by the `AXIS_SWEEP_3` and `AXIS_SWEEP_3_32` broadphase algorithms.
The `SIMPLE` and `DBVT` algorithms ignore those parameters.

== Contact-and-constraint solver types

By default, a
http://allenchou.net/2013/12/game-physics-constraints-sequential-impulse[Sequential Impulse (SI) solver]
is used to resolve contacts and constraints.
To specify a different type of solver, invoke `setSolverType()`
before attaching the AppState:

[source,java]
----
bulletAppState.setSolverType(SolverType.Dantzig);
----

NOTE: For soft-body simulations, SI is the only supported solver type.

NOTE: The NNCG solver doesn't support multibodies.

== Advanced rigid-body friction

In addition to the basic friction parameter (which affects sliding friction)
each rigid body has 2 additional friction parameters:
one for rolling friction and one for spinning friction.
Both parameters default to zero.

_Rolling friction_ generates torque orthogonal to the contact normal,
which tends to slow down a rolling body.
_Spinning friction_ generates torque parallel to the contact normal,
which tends to prevent a body from spinning when grasped.

To see rolling and spinning friction in action, run
{url-examples}/PoolDemo.java[the PoolDemo application].

To simulate objects with grooved surfaces, it's also possible to configure
a rigid body for _anisotropic friction_:
friction that depends on the direction of relative motion.
