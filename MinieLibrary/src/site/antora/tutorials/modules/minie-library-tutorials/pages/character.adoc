= An introduction to character physics
:url-api: https://stephengold.github.io/Minie/minie/javadoc/com/jme3/bullet

The {url-api}/object/PhysicsCharacter.html[`PhysicsCharacter`]
class (a subclass of
{url-api}/collision/PhysicsCollisionObject.html[`PhysicsCollisionObject`])
provides a simplified physics model for characters.

To associate a character with a `Spatial`, there's
{url-api}/control/CharacterControl.html[`CharacterControl`],
a physics control that extends
{url-api}/objects/PhysicsCharacter.html[`PhysicsCharacter`].

NOTE: Once again, the physics control and its collision object
are the same object.
