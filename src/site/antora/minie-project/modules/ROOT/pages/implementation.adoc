= How Minie works
:cplusplus: C&#43;&#43;
:url-enwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki

For physics simulation and collision detection,
Minie uses https://pybullet.org/wordpress[the _Bullet Physics SDK_],
a mature, open-source, 3-D physics simulator,
released under https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/LICENSE.txt[a Zlib license].

To enable efficient simulation of moving meshes, Minie also incorporates Khaled Mamou's
https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd[Volumetric-Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition _(V-HACD)_ algorithm].

== Native libraries

Bullet and V-HACD are written in {cplusplus}, so Minie uses
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/intro.html[the Java Native Interface (JNI)]
to access their objects and methods.

All {cplusplus} source code associated with Minie
(including JNI "glue code" and a modified partial snapshot of the Bullet SDK)
resides in https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme[the Libbulletjme repository].
The Libbulletjme project builds _native libraries_
for each of the 12 platforms Minie supports:

* Windows (32-bit and 64-bit),
* Linux (x86-64, x86, armhf, and aarch64),
* macOS (32-bit and 64-bit), and
* Android (armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64).

On desktop platforms, JMonkeyEngine automatically loads
the appropriate native library
during initialization of the `JmeDesktopSystem` class
if it detects Minie's `NativeMeshUtil` class.
On Android platforms, the native library is loaded (if present)
during static initialization of the `JmeAndroidSystem` class.

== Collision objects and spaces

Collision detection is organized around _collision objects_
that interact in the context of a _collision space_.
Collision objects can be _soft_ (varying shape) or _rigid_ (non-varying shape).
Rigid objects can be _mobile_ (moving) or _static_ (non-moving).
And mobile objects can be _dynamic_ (moved by {url-enwiki}/Force[forces],
{url-enwiki}/Torque[torques], and {url-enwiki}/Impulse_(physics)[impulses])
or _kinematic_ (moved directly by external calculations).

In this document, collision spaces that simulate forces, torques, and impulses
are referred to as _physics spaces_.

By themselves, collision objects are invisible,
while scene-graph spatials have no effect on physics.
To visualize a collision object, it must be associated
with one or more scene-graph spatial(s).
For debugging purposes, Minie can visualize
collision objects by auto-generating spatials for them.
For full-custom visualization, a _physics control_
should be used to associate collision objects with spatials.

A collision object's location and orientation are quantified
using _physics-space coordinates_.
These typically correspond to world coordinates of the scene.
However, Minie supports scaling the physics space relative to the scene,
in which case the _physics-space units_ (psu)
might differ the from world units (wu).

== Discrete time and collision detection

Within a physics space, simulation occurs in discrete _time steps_,
which need not correspond to rendered frames.
Each time step consists of 4 _phases_:

. _forward dynamics part one_,
  to apply known forces and torques
  and predict the next position of each collision object,
. _broadphase collision detection_,
  to quickly determine (using axis-aligned bounding boxes)
  which object pairs might possibly collide,
. _narrowphase collision detection_,
  to compute actual contacts (if any) between between objects, and
. _forward dynamics part 2_,
  to apply contact forces, solve constraints, and update positions.

Collisions are reported asynchronously to listeners registered at the space.
For fast-moving objects,
Minie offers optional continuous collision detection (CCD)
using swept spheres;
such collisions are reported to those same listeners.

== App states

To simplify the creation and management of physics spaces,
Minie provides _app states_.
The simplest of these is `BulletAppState`; it manages a single
space without any soft objects or multibodies.
Simulation of the space can take place on the render thread
or else on a dedicated _physics thread_.
Either way, the app state attempts to synchronize to real time
during each rendered frame.

Debug visualization can be enabled or disabled simply by setting a parameter.
