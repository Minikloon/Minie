= The Minie project

Minie is a physics library for JMonkeyEngine
that takes physics-based games to the next level.
Use it to:

. add solidity to walls, characters, projectiles, landscapes, and vehicles
. detect collisions between complex shapes
. simulate characters and buildings collapsing in real time
. simulate cloth, rope, and deformable volumes,
  including their interactions with rigid bodies and each other

Forked from the jme3-bullet library, Minie adds many features
while preserving most of the jme3-bullet API.
Most JME physics examples can use Minie without modification,
and Minie adds its own demos and tutorials to help you get started.
